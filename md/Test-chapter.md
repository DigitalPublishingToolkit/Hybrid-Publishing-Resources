# Test title and the Autonomy of Art: The Culture of Power, the Power of Culture[^Test-chapter_1]

Author name

Lorem Ipsum, advanced neoliberal reforms are taking place at a much
faster pace than in other parts of the world. These reforms have
delivered not only new forms of life and making a living but also new
sensibilities. The erosion of the social contract brought by these
reforms, has had tangible (all negative) effects on the social tissue.
This has materialized, for example, in what is known as the most violent
and dangerous city in the world, Ciudad Juárez, where in 2010 alone,
3000 people were killed. Bearing this in mind, I am defining
neoliberalism as a *sensibility* that shapes subjectivities, permeates
art and culture, differentiates and homogenizes people, molds lives and
desires, mistakes information for knowledge, gives shape to space and
thus to social relations, normalizes violence, creates ways of seeing
the world giving shape to common sense that justifies destruction and
dispossession with notions progress and development, or that tries to
solve economic precarity with self-help and permanent education. I argue
that neoliberalism is more than a system that is ruled by a free market
economy, which implies the privatization of the welfare state and an
array of government services (for example: education, health, energy),
subcontracting to the private sector and changes in labor laws and
worker’s rights as well as a transnational division of labor. The system
of control under neoliberalism combines a militarized police regime with
repressive tolerance, the logic of securitization with granting freedom
of expression and ‘quality of life.’ The political figures, molded and
governed by the neoliberal regime itself are: *homo oeconomicus* (or
entrepreneur, responsible for his own well-being and manager of his own
human capital) and the subject of rights (the State is in charge of
guaranteeing that his human rights are respected). Aside from an
economic-political system, I see neoliberalism as a way of relating to
the world, to nature, to things and beings, which presupposes unlimited
growth and development. It is also a way of living and working: human
beings are being put to work beyond their capacities, erasing the
distinction between the leisure and work time. Neoliberalism is also a
sensibility that establishes the terms of empathy and sympathy and has
outlined a new notion of alterity. Configured as ‘social responsibility’
or social work, to ‘help’ the Other means to focus on the (so-called)
‘secondary malfunctions’ of the current capitalist system by
disseminating personal and managerial practices such as tolerance,
showing respect, nurturing dialogue, transparency and social
collaboration. In this sense, the “Other” is a ‘community to come,’ the
‘subject of rights’ (and to ethical restitution: refugees, displaced,
immigrants, those who live under a ‘state of exception’), the
*underclass*, that is, he or she who will be permanently outside
globalizing process, including access to education, jobs and
consumption. The category of the “Other” encompasses as well, political
and religious fundamentalists, fanatics who are outside globalizing and
modernizing processes by choice. These *Others* are sometimes given
faces in the media or in art by spectacularizing their subjectivity but
obviating the processes that placed them in those very situations that
render their lives precarious and endangered in the first place.

## Section

### This is a subsection

What has this got to do with the autonomy of art? As we will see, with
postmodernism, art and culture came to be at the center of social,
political and economic processes and are now inextricable from work,
production, consumption and subjectivity: in the neoliberal regime, art
in particular and culture in general are being used actively as
compensation and improvement of tools, normalizing and spreading the
antithesis of autonomous art, that is, ‘useful art.’ Subsumed to
political action, much of contemporary art has taken up a political role
as either ‘sensible politics’ or ‘socially engaged artwork.’ This is
tied to the fact that in our current world order, as Vishmidt and
Stakemeier point out, “Art no longer designates a reproductive and
representational realm, but one of productivity and social power” and
thus the autonomy of art itself has become a problem – in so far as it
has become a realm for the production of added value.[^Test-chapter_2]

In the September 2013 editorial of *e-flux journal*, the editors stated
that art is produced at a double bind: while art can be complicit or
instrumentalized by power, its autonomy is located in an imaginary
space. What do they mean by this? First, that art, in order to be
*seen*, depends on a platform – an institution – and thus needs to be
part of some art world. Second, that the autonomy of art – as a separate
regime or an isolated sphere – is a fantasy. In order to consider the
autonomy of art outside of this double bind, Clement Greenberg tied the
autonomy of art – as art’s for art’s sake – to the avant-garde situating
criticality within the discipline or medium of art itself. Clearly
taking a position against socialist realist painting and those debates
of the 1930s relying on the relationship between art and politics
(embodied for example, by socialist realism or Mexican muralist
painting, which was very popular in New York in the 1930s) in
Greenberg’s definition, avant-garde (Modernist) painting was
characterized by self-critique in the sense that its formal expression
is a meditation on the qualities of the medium of painting. This meant
extricating figuration from the arts, and an essentialist understanding
of the mediums of art: for Greenberg, ‘purity’ was political –
especially if it was seen as an embodiment of a free nation versus the
authoritarian Soviet Union.

Postmodernism could be understood as an effort to break with Greenberg’s
disciplinary totalitarianism. Taking up the Dadaist and surrealist
avant-garde’s goals of unifying art and life, postmodernism thrived with
the advent of interdisciplinary strategies and in the symbiosis of art
with everything else. Post-war art continued the vanguardist critique of
the bourgeois notions of autonomous art and expressive artists,
embracing everyday objects, transforming the artist’s function,
questioning the institution of art or attacking it in the anarchist
manner.[^Test-chapter_3] Following Hal Foster, art from the 1950s and 1960s
represents the failure to destroy the institution of art and the
institutionalization of the avant-garde.[^Test-chapter_4] If Greenberg advocated
aesthetic autonomy with the purpose of resisting illustrational meanings
prone to kitsch and commercial forces, post-modernist’s inter
disciplinary strategies led art, in Foster’s words, “to become embedded
into life under the terms of mass capitalism, while it became
appropriated by the culture industry.”[^Test-chapter_5] Due to its ‘post-medium’
condition, as Rosalind Krauss termed ‘postmodern interdisciplinarity,’
art is enmeshed with reality, and its materials can range from social
interaction, scientific research, montage, etc. With postmodernism, the
politics of the autonomy of art meant breaking away from in Greenberg’s
sense of purity and thus art’s autonomy came to be conceived as
“provisional, always defined diacritically (as something supplemental to
art) and situated politically, always *semi*.”[^Test-chapter_6]

Beyond postmodernism, parallel to the increase of corporate subsidy to
the arts, there has been a recent boom in private collecting and thus a
market boom; the value of art is speculative and reflects the logic of
finance-based economy (and risk), and the economy and critical art share
the core value of ‘innovation.’ In this regard, neoliberalism has meant
for the arts privatization or the collusion between the private and the
public sector in order to subsidize them. In the past decade or so (and
in the US long before that), corporations have played an important role
in investing in culture, as institutions and corporations seek to play
an important role in communicating the private sector point of view on
an array of critical public topics.[^Test-chapter_7] If art was previously supported
by the state, because culture was considered to be an asset to the
nation, today, corporations have appropriated this function, as they
sponsor and jury art shows, grant awards and funds and collect artworks.
Meanwhile, they promote their perspective on critical public topics.[^Test-chapter_8]
In a 1998 article, art historian Chin-tao Wu highlighted how
corporations appropriated the concept of innovation – also known as
innovative disruption or creative destruction – in order to redefine its
meaning in corporate terms. She quotes Philip Morris Inc.’s – the U.S.
cigarette company – executive vice-president, John Murphy, on their
sponsorship of the 1969 exhibition, *When Attitudes Become Form*:

> …We feel it is appropriate that we participate in bringing these works
> to the attention of the public, for there is a key element in this
> ‘new art’ which has its counterpart in the business world. That
> element is *innovation* – without which it would be impossible for
> progress to be made in any segment in society.[^Test-chapter_9]

Furthermore, in the context of neoliberal reforms and sensibility, there
is a global tendency to subdue contemporary art to the politics of
culture administration, which implies “democratizing culture” making it
accessible to the masses, using it as a tool for the well-being of
society, for the reconstruction or healing of a community or society
that has experienced violence. Cultural institutions subsidized by
corporations and individual patrons apparently follow progressive
agendas promoting political – or socially minded art. For instance,
*Creative Time* in New York (funded by a mix of state and corporate
support) supports public and community art, with the goal of enabling
the politicization of social space with cultural intervention. This
organization sponsored Tania Bruguera’s “Immigrant Movement
International,” a project developed in Queens (2011), New York, which
the artist describes as: a flexible community space and long-term
socio-political movement, public workshops, events, actions and
partnerships with immigrant and service organizations; the artist
further qualified her project as “useful art.”[^Test-chapter_10] The problem is that
initiatives such as this one, render opaque the real economic conditions
that led to situations of immigrant precarity to begin with: immigrants
are local signs of complex global forces operating on their conditions
of life and work at home and abroad. Many would argue that subsidy to
projects like Bruguera’s signals the transfer of social work to artistic
work funded by the private sector. In regards to this, politics comes
into the scene through art as social work in the name of ‘public
interest,’ only to become subject to administration, engineering and a
technocratic way of administering social problems, configuring the
private version of the welfare state.[^Test-chapter_11] Furthermore, as the corporate
support to the establishment of antagonistic spaces becomes gradually
institutionalized within society, the question rises, after Gregory
Sholette , “Who owns cultural capital and who has the right to use it?”
.

As for him, corporate involvement in the arts is akin – or perhaps
integral to – to the current erosion of public space.[^Test-chapter_12] Moreover, as
cultural spaces become institutional bastions of democratic
self-expression and sites for social reconciliation and self-help,
dissent is criminalized and forcefully punished worldwide.

It becomes evident that in the neoliberal globalized world, art and
culture are central to neoliberal processes as agents of globalization,
as tools for improvement and development, counterinsurgency and
pacification. An extreme example could be the ‘culturally sensible’
occupation of Iraq as described by Nato Thompson (director of *Creative
Time*). In uncritical terms, Thompson recounts how General David
Petraeus wrote a field manual geared at changing people’s attitudes
towards American occupation in Mosul; as exemplified in:

> A story about counterinsurgency and community organizing, about
> getting to know people as an occupying force, and getting to know
> people as neighbors. It is a story about the military entering the
> terrain of that thing called culture.[^Test-chapter_13]

In this regard, a ‘cultural approach’ to military occupation is akin to
artistic social and community practices, as both involve “getting to
know people to be able to change the landscapes of life and of
power.”[^Test-chapter_14] In the case of civilians in Mosul, this is done obviating
their experiences under attack. This cultural turn in the U.S. military
machinery took place a few years after theorist Frederic Jameson
diagnosed a “cultural turn” in capitalism, arguing that social space had
been completely saturated with the image of culture. This is because in
professional and daily activities, as well as in the various forms of
entertainment we enjoy, society consumes cultural products all the time.
The postmodern “cultural turn” diagnosed by Jameson, was further
elaborated by George Yúdice upon observing (in 2003) that the uses of
culture had undergone an unprecedented expansion not just in the
marketplace but also along social, political, and economic lines.
According to Yúdice, since the state and corporations already utilize
culture as a tool as they search for economic and sociopolitical
betterment, culture has become a resource and a compensatory device to
the ravages neoliberal policies have caused on the social tissue: both
give meaning and symbolic representations, provide mechanisms of solace,
as well as tools for re-invention and amelioration.[^Test-chapter_15] In this
context, the line between public programs and relational aesthetics or
participative art appears to be increasingly blurred. Former Mexican
president Felipe Calderón made a public appearance in February 2012 in
Ciudad Juárez before a sign that stated: “No More Weapons.” The
billboard measured 8 x 21 m, and was built by soldiers of the National
Defense Department with 3 tons of assault weapons confiscated at the
border and molten into bricks. During the ceremony in which the
billboard was unveiled, Calderón turned toward the Mexican-American
border and begged the U.S. (in bad English): “No more weapons! Dear
friends of the United States, Mexico needs your help to stop this
terrible violence we are suffering.” During this trip, Calderón also
participated in the destruction of 6 thousand confiscated weapons, and
planted a tree at a Community Center. Calderon’s propagandistic gestures
immediately recall the language of socially engaged contemporary art,
particularly, Pedro Reyes’ intervention, *Palas por pistolas* in
Culiacán in 2008 (also executed in Juárez in the same week of Calderon’s
visit). Reyes’ project of exchanging shovels for weapons was subsidized
by two predominant Mexican corporations: Trupper (which producers
hardware) and Coppel (which sells appliances and other goods). For this
project, Reyes devised a Television campaign inviting citizens to give
up their weapons in exchange for a coupon exchangeable for appliances.
The artist collected 1527 weapons, which were destroyed at a military
zone in a public act. Giving his action a further twist, Reyes sought to
have the rests of the weapons welded together to produce 1527 shovels
carrying an inscription telling the story of the weapon they represented
(this was not possible due to technical reasons, so Trupper ended up
donating them). The engraved shovels were distributed in art
institutions and public schools and adults and children planted 1527
trees. To Reyes, this ritual had a pedagogical purpose: “to show the
people how an agent of death can become an agent of life.”[^Test-chapter_16] A
similar public purge of weapons in exchange for appliances (and
tablets), is currently happening in Mexico City led by a “Pink Ladies
Brigade.” These relational actions – both by General Petraeus’ and by
the Mexican government, show how the language of contemporary art has
been appropriated by propaganda for its purposes, making politics and
aesthetics indistinguishable, as both operate in the realm of symbolic
and perceptive work. These are also examples of the predominant idea
that violence can be eased – or appeased – through cultural intervention
and in the Mexican case, by giving away highly desirable goods.

Aside from this ‘artistic approach’ to social, political and military
action, sensible production has taken up a political function, as
political work has been developed into a matter of codification using
medial forms with the purpose of creating a terrain for political acts,
creating an “activist imaginary” made of political fields constituted by
images. Political action embedded in cultural forms implies making
things public as a way of signs.[^Test-chapter_17] An example could be Trevor
Paglen’s (sometimes abstract or blurry) photographs of top-secret
governmental, nuclear and military sites. Works such as Paglen’s, seek
to make visible the invisible under the premise that such an act is
political. Yet, what images such as Paglen’s represent is vague in
political terms. What I find problematic is that the gap between
*political* representation and *aesthetic* representation is now wider
than ever. Representation means “making the absent present,” which is
always an incomplete task because totality is impossible to convey, and
it works in two senses. As *Vertreten* (or political representation) it
means taking the place of others in order to speak on their behalf, and
as *Darstellen* (or aesthetic representation) it is the form of
representation that implies describing the other in the first person.
Representation was brought into a crisis in the 1960s because it was
accused of hiding the fact that the speaker was occupying the place of
the represented and thus, workers and minorities were prompted to speak
on their behalf and in the first person. Nowadays, however, the gap
between political (*Vertreten*) and aesthetic (*Darstellen*)
representations is wider than ever because whatever political acts
encoded in medial forms may represent, it renders it unstable – partly
because politics have become unrepresentable due to lack of stable
political subjects – as they are collective enunciations constantly
‘becoming.’ In this context, “expressive” politics is valued over
representation because “it embodies rebellious subjectivities expressing
themselves without delegation and they do so through formal and symbolic
richness.”[^Test-chapter_18] One of the issues that rises is that there is lack of a
common ground to universalize the multiplicity of singular struggles and
social movements scattered across the world like archipelagos. There are
just too many images in the Infosphere, and ‘sensible politics’ exists
for and by its own public, which is made up of social movements and
politically minded cultural producers. In this regard, cultural
infrastructure functions as the platform for ‘sensible politics,’ in
which curators, museum directors and board members (sometimes
representing corporate interests) select and contextualize artwork that
presents certain events and social actions thus determining the
boundaries of public thinking.

Aside from its compensatory role, culture (insofar at it is ‘creativity’
and cognitive production), is not only at the center of political
action, but is also embedded in production and consumption processes,
and neoliberalism – in so far as it has thrived in post-fordist
(flexible) forms and conditions of labor – which had taken up the
characteristics of aesthetic production. Signs and nascent meanings,
desires and projections meet in the market because the post-fordist
economy is based on manufacturing experiences, signs and information.
The core of the knowledge economy is creativity and this is why
qualities of aesthetic production have become hegemonic and have
transformed labor and consumption processes as well as aesthetic
experiences. Not only sensations and feelings are being trivialized and
packaged for sale. Disinterestedness (the core of aesthetic experience
as defined by Kant) has also vanished.[^Test-chapter_19] This arises as the result of
aesthetic experience being enslaved for profit, as well as subsumed to
“political” efficiency – in the sense of State and corporate strategic
investment in culture, as well as it was the transformation of political
action into sensible forms – as opposed to action. These tendencies are
a result of what Stephen Shaviro describes as “the ruthless cognition of
aesthetic sensations and feelings”, as they were transformed into data,
exploited forms of labor, which were marketed as fresh experiences,
exciting lifestyle choices, or as socially-responsible cultural
activities. In the political arena, thirty years of neoliberalism have
crushed any confidence that we might have had on the social contract. If
artists used to identify with the proletariat and social struggles
before, nowadays, aesthetic production – which is lacking a reflexive
program in regards to the conditions of its own production – is geared
just toward the supplementing of the entertainment market with
cultivated and knowledgeable new experiences and sensations.
Furthermore, through subsidizing art and cultural projects,
corporations, states and arts patrons put into practice following
principle of the Prince Claus Fund: “There can be no development without
culture, and there can be no cultural development without freedom of
debate.”[^Test-chapter_20] As this quote becomes evermore evident, the public expects
from culture and art rigorous accountability, critical questioning,
democratic access, dialogue and openness as well as equal representation
in the visual regime (and this is posited as the road to development).
In this context, culture is perceived as “a basic need,” as the founding
principle of Prince Claus Fund states. Thus, states, corporations, the
private sector and society attribute to art a decisive political role on
the one hand, as they invest in culture with the purpose of generating
political and economic surplus value. Bearing in mind that the autonomy
of art is always a political matter, could art be politicized beyond its
autonomy as a site for added value?

The condition of possibility of autonomous, committed art under the new
neoliberal world order, is radically different from what we see as the
autonomy of art under modernism (as *l’art pour l’art*) and post-modern
interdisciplinarity. These imply the institutionalization of the
avant-garde and the subsumption of art to the market, bearing in mind
that the emancipatory promises of modernism (criticality, self-design,
creativity) are now located at the center of our everyday lives both via
consumption and production processes. Theodor Adorno’s take on the
autonomy of art in his (1962) essay entitled “Commitment,” can be
helpful here. In this essay, Adorno responds to Jean-Paul Sartre’s
aesthetic manifesto *What is Literature?* and elaborates a theoretical
debate about engaged literature and autonomous art. According to Adorno,
there are two kinds of works of art. On the one hand, there are works
that “are vulgarly assimilated to the existence against which they
protest.”[^Test-chapter_21] These works “are content with being mere fetishes or a
pass-time, and thus degenerate and become de-politicized cultural
merchandise.”[^Test-chapter_22] This de-politicization, for Adorno is in fact, deeply
political – much politically or socially minded contemporary art would
fit into this category. On the other hand, there is *engaged autonomous
ar*t, which, as art, is necessarily detached from reality. Adorno
defines the autonomy of art not in the sense of its strictly formalist
aspect (although like Walter Benjamin, Adorno also vouches for works of
art that are both formally and politically progressive). For Adorno,
autonomous art negates a direct connection to reality. The distance that
autonomous art has from reality, however, is mediated by reality itself:
this means that a work of art cannot come out of the blue – its origin
is a reaction against reality. Adorno, as does Benjamin, draws a
distinction between ‘commitment’ and ‘tendency.’ Committed art does not
bear the intention of generating betterment measures, legislative acts
or practical institutions (like propaganda) or even transmitting a
concrete ideology, but it operates at the level of fundamental
attitudes. For Adorno, autonomous and engaged works of art operate at
the level of abandoning the social contract with reality and “cease to
speak as if they were reporting the facts: this is the moment in which a
work of art makes people’s hair stand up.”[^Test-chapter_23] According to Adorno, the
shock of the unintelligible (or the ambiguous), is able to communicate
more than what is legible and explicit. In that sense, works of art are
autonomous, instead of heteronomous. Heteronomy implies that an artwork
is subject to a different power, a law that is external and foreign to
art and to its formal logic. When it is autonomous, engaged art is
neither subject to empirical reality nor to a correct political
tendency. Art’s autonomy protects it from popularization, from its
adoption by the market and it implies liberating it from any other
external purpose: from being useful. In this manner, an autonomous work
of art does not convey a message nor does it need to convince the public
(or preach to the converted). And although it opposes society,
autonomous art is still part of it.

If the autonomy of modern art implied considering art as a realm
distanced from reality, art’s post-medium condition means that it has
become a niche within reality.[^Test-chapter_24] What is thus at stake in autonomous
art nowadays, would be to posit it as an experience of reality that is
fundamentally foreign and antagonistic to the prevailing reality. If the
autonomy of art should be located in the realm of reproduction as Marina
Vischmidt argues[^Test-chapter_25] – it would oppose the realm of production of the
social, political and economic surplus value, as it would go against
embodying power and the entrepreneurial model of work. Producing
difference, dragging out the laboring conditions hidden within it,
autonomous art would imply mimesis with distancing itself. Beyond being
used as a tool, autonomous art would refuse becoming an instrument
against its own illusions, as well as refusing to become a political
force, or to be subjected to interests foreign to itself or simply
becoming a pleasing commodity. Overcoming self-censorship, it would
cease to participate in the economy of the globalized artworld,
especially in the name of critical practices, political work or social
justice, abandoning its claim to become a progressive social force.[^Test-chapter_26]
Above all, it would work against the power of culture and the culture of
power.
